# Test Your Emotes
## Emote Previewer for Twitch &amp; Discord - Version 1.0.0
 
Welcome to the Emote Previewer for Twitch & Discord - a dedicated platform for artists who want to see their designs come to life in the context of a Twitch or Discord chat before the final release. This is the initial version of a utility tool that streamlines the testing phase of emote design.

As this is version 1.0.0, it covers the basics of a tester website. The current features allow artists to evaluate the aesthetics and visibility of their emotes in different sizes and chat backgrounds by hosting the repository locally. You can replace placeholder images with your emote designs and instantly see them in a chat-like UI.

The upcoming updates will bring significant improvements to the application's accessibility, making it more user-friendly and inclusive. We are also working on adding more functionalities to make this tool even more useful for emote artists.
How to Use:

    - Clone this repository.
    - Replace the placeholder images in the designated folder with your own emote images.
    - Host the repository locally.
    - Access the web interface and see your emotes in action.

Feel free to provide feedback and contribute to this tool to make it even better. Stay tuned for the upcoming updates!
